## 4.1. Intro

- how to find the center of a tree?
- this is the sort of problem that you might encounter in a coding interview or a competitive programming contest.
- finding the center of a tree is a handy algorithm to know because you will see it from time to time in the subroutine of other algorithms and it's also a useful way of selecting the root node when you tryna root a tree which we talked about [here](../3.%20Rooting%20a%20tree/README.md).
- one thing to be aware of when finding the center of a tree is that there can be more than one center, either you run into the case where a tree that has a unique center which is nice or you run into a tree which has two centers, however there can't be more than two centers, do you know why?
