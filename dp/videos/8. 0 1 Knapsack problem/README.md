## 8.1. Intro

- Knapsack problem is a cool problem in computer science
- In particular, we are going to talk about the 0/1 knapsack problem
- It's a very popular problem that arises everywhere in computer science
- It's important to know how to sove it
- the decision version of the knapsack problem is np-complete but we can achieve pseudo polynomial time with dynamic programming.

## 8.2. Problem Statement

Given a set of objects which have both a value and a weight $(Vi, Wi)$ what is the `maximum value` we can obtain by selecting a subset of these objects such that the sum of the weights does not exceed a certain capacity (i.e the knapsack capacity)?
