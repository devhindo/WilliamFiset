# Depth First Search Algorithm

*Time Complexity: $O(V+E)$*
V : vertices.
E : Edges.

- By itself it isn't so useful, but when augmented to perform other tasks such as connectivity, or finding bridges/articulation points then DFS really shines.
- a DFS plunges depth first into a graph without regard for which edge it takes next until it cannot go any further at which point it backtracks and continue.
