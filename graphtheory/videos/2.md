# Graph Theory Introduction

It's really important to be able to recognize what type of graph you're working with or what type of graph you need to solve a particular problem.

## Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graphs** - edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graphs** - edges have direction.
- **Weighted Graphs** - edges have a weight to represent arbitrary values. You also need to specify whether the graph is directed or undirected.
- **Special Graphs:**
  - **Trees**
    - undirected, acyclic `having no cycles` , connected graphs.
    - a graph with n nodes and n-1 edges.
  - **Rooted Trees**
    - a tree with a designated root node where every edge either points away from or towards the root node. When edges point away from the root the graph is called an **arborescence** `out-tree` and **anti-arborescence** `in-tree` otherwise.
  - **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**
    - directed, acyclic graphs `no cycles`.
    - Cool fact: All out-trees are DAGs but not all DAGs are out-trees.
  - **Bipartite Graphs**
    - graphs where the nodes can be split into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a node in one set to a node in the other set.
    - a fancy way of saying that the graph can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Or, no two nodes that are connected by an edge have the same color.
    - **Complete Graphs**
      - there is a unique edge between every pair of nodes.
      - considered as worst case scenario for graph algorithms which could be useful in stuying the performance of algorithms on ordinary graphs.
